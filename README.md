# Big-Data-Analytics-Project-on-COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Incentives
This project analyzes the Provider Relief Fund COVID-19 Nursing Home Quality Incentive Program, which allocated $2 billion to U.S. nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce infection and mortality rates. The study evaluates the distribution and impact of these funds, focusing on performance measures like infection and mortality rates. Various data analysis steps were employed, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations through scatter plots, bar graphs, density plots, and box plots. Key findings indicate that states like California received the highest funding due to effective performance. The research, utilizing Python, Excel, and R on the Spyder and RStudio platforms, provides critical insights into fund allocation and effectiveness, despite some data limitations, enhancing understanding for future healthcare funding strategies.
